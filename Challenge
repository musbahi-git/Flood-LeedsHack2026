   CHALLENGE ALIGNMENT
This project is eligible for multiple Leeds Hack 2026 challenges.  
Each section below explains **what problem is solved, how it is solved, and why the solution matters.

_____________________________________________________________________________________________________

1️⃣ Overall Challenge — Systems Rebooted

WHAT problem does this solve?
Flood emergency response systems are currently:
- fragmented across multiple platforms
- reactive rather than predictive
- difficult for individuals to act on under pressure

People receive alerts, but no clear guidance on what action to take.

HOW does HAVEN solve it?
HAVEN reboots flood response as a single end-to-end system by:

- ingesting official flood alerts and live weather data
- learning from historical flood extents
- calculating safe evacuation routes, not just shortest routes
- displaying open shelters with live capacity
- enabling community reports and help requests
- dynamically rerouting users as conditions change

All routing decisions are deterministic and explainable, not black-box.

WHY this is a rebooted system
Instead of placing responsibility on individuals to interpret warnings,  
HAVEN turns information into action.

It transforms flood response from:
> “Here is a warning”  
to  
> “Here is your safest route right now, and here’s why.”

This directly embodies the Systems Rebooted theme.

 2️⃣ PwC Challenge — Rewiring Communities: Connecting People Better

WHAT community problem does this address?
During floods:
- people don’t know which routes are safe
- shelters are difficult to find
- official data often lags real conditions
- communities struggle to coordinate help

This leads to panic, misinformation, and isolation.

HOW does HAVEN rewire communities?
HAVEN enables real-time community coordination by:

- sharing safe evacuation routes
- making shelters visible as community hubs
- allowing residents to report flooded roads
- enabling help requests for vulnerable users
- giving authorities real-time ground truth

The system supports peer-to-peer intelligence, not just one-way alerts.

WHY this fits the PwC challenge
The PwC challenge values:
- reduced friction in accessing help
- peer-to-peer support
- trust and transparency
- speed and robustness

FloodSafe Leeds addresses all of these by design, making it a strong fit.

3️⃣ Parallax Challenge — Use the Past to Predict the Future

WHAT is being predicted?
HAVEN predicts which road segments are likely to become unsafe during flooding — even before official closures occur.

HOW is prediction achieved?
The system combines historical and live datasets at road-segment level:

- historic flood extent polygons
- altitude and terrain slope
- distance to rivers and drainage
- rainfall accumulation (past 1–24 hours)
- current rainfall intensity
- short-term rainfall forecasts

These features generate a risk score that penalises flood-prone routes during routing.



aWHY this fits Parallax
This is **multivariate forecasting** using historical data,weather data, measured rainfall to anticipate future risk, exactly matching the Parallax challenge focus.
